# Decentral Support
Decentral Support is a place where people can learn about bitcoin in a simple and positive way. We try to answer all bitcoin related questions. There is no official place to get support for bitcoin, but we do our best to provide such a place. This website is created by a group of bitcoin enthusiasts (programmers) and is open source, just like wikipedia.
